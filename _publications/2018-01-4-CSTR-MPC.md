Optimal control of a CSTR represents a challenging task. The proposed paper discusses two issues. The first one addresses control of pH in a chemical vessel, where the reaction between sodium hydroxide and acetic acid occurs. The objective here is to improve control performance of a well tuned PI controller. It will be shown that this can be achieved by introducing a reference governor scheme. The second problem, elaborated in this paper, is the implementation of the reference governor paradigm. Concretely, we aim to design a fast and cheap MPC-based feedback controller. To achieve these goals, we exploit the region-less explicit technique, which efficiently reduces memory footprint issues of standard explicit MPC schemes. Such MPC-based reference governor was employed to control pH in the chemical vessel. Its control performance is compared with conventional PI controller. Finally, comparison of implementation requirements of region-less and region-based explicit techniques is investigated.
