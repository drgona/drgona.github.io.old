I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Optimization and Control Group](https://eib.pnnl.gov/optimizationcontrol/default.asp) at Pacific Northwest National laboratory located in Richland WA.
My current research interests fall in the intersection of model-based optimal control and machine learning with applications in the energy sector, building control in particular.

I have a PhD in Control Engineering from  [Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava](https://www.uiam.sk/index.php), Slovakia, advised by [Michal Kvasnica](https://www.uiam.sk/~kvasnica/).
My PhD thesis was on [Model Predictive Control with Applications in Building Thermal Comfort Control](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323219837_Model_Predictive_Control_with_Applications_in_Building_Thermal_Comfort_Control).
My MSc thesis was co-supervised by [Johan LÃ¶fberg](http://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/johanl/) with the topic [Efficient Modeling of Hybrid Systems](https://www.uiam.sk/assets/fileAccess.php?id=1305&type=1).
Before joining PNNL I was a postdoc  at KU Leuven, Belgium, in the [Thermal Systems Simulation research group](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/research/thermal_systems) led by [Lieve Helsen](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00009689).
At KU Leuven I was working on the cloud-based implementation of model predictive control (MPC) in a real-world  office building in Belgium. At PNNL I work with [Draguna Vrabie](https://energyenvironment.pnnl.gov/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=2900) on tighter integration of deep learning methods with MPC and control theory.
My publications are available  on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A-EA2KsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Drgona) and my
open source repositories can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/drgona) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/%7B96405cec-dcb4-4f6f-8df3-45f6cf31b0f6%7D/) profiles.
In my free time I do meditation and [painting](https://sk.pinterest.com/jandrgona3/jans-paintings/).
